Azure storage
=============
PAAS
Managed cloud storage service --> high availability, durable, scalable and redundant storage

Files, messages, tables and other types of information

1 subscription --> 100 accounts --> 1 account * 500 tb

3 categories
============

1. Storage for virtual machines (like disks and files)
2. Unstructured data (videos, audio, images, messages, text) --> blobs & datalake stores
3. Structured data --> tables, azure sql db, cosmos db

types of storage
================
Blob storage --> Object storage --> Huge amount of unstructured data such as text, image, videos, audio, data for back up, disaster recovery or binary data
Files --> Highly available network file shares, uses SMB protocol (standard server message block) --> suitable for migration of data
Tables --> Structured sql/nosql data, key & value pair --> schemaless design
Queues --> Store and retrieve messages, each message of maximum size of 64 kb --> can store millions of messages

Performance
===========
Standard --> Backed by HDD (magnetic drives), lowest cost per gb, best for applications that requires bulk storage, data is accesses infrequently
Premium --> Are backed SSD (Solid state drives), offers low latency and consistant performance, use with axure vm's disks, best for i/o intensive applications --> db


General purpose v1 --> Legacy, doesn't support performance tiers, 
General purpose v2
Blob storage


Performance tiers

Hot   --> Optimized for storing data that is accesses frequently like VM, files, images, videos that are in regular use --> storage cost (highest) and read cost (low)
Cool --> Optimied for storing data that is infrequently accessed and stored for atleast 30 days like back up data, storage cost(low) and read cost (higher than hot tier)
Archive --> Optimized for storing data that is really accessed and stored for atleast 180 days with flexible latency requirements, storage cost (least) and read cost (highest)


Blob containers & categories
============================

Containers --> Directory, can store many blobs under one container

Block blob --> Any text, video, audio, image files
Page blob --> random access files upto 8 tb --> Virtual hard drive --> serve as a disk for vm
Append blob --> Made up of multiple block blobs, optimized for append operations --> ideal for log data in vm

Storage replication
===================
LRS --> 3 copies of data in 3 storage boxes within the same data center
ZRS --> 3 copies of data in multiple data centres within same region
GRS --> 3 copies of data in primary region, 3 copies in a secondary region
RA-GRS --> Same as GRS, Read only access to secondary data centre
GZRS --> ZRS synchronously and single physical location in secondary region
RA-GRS --> same GZRS but read only access to the secondary region
